					<h2>About the Game</h2>
					<p>
						The world of entrepreneurship is large, full of possibility,
						and--most of all-- random. The best method to teach you of the
						process behind and entrepreneurial venture is, and always will be,
						experience.<br><br>
						In this simulation, you take the role of an entrepreneur who is in
						the process of starting their own business. In order to begin your
						process, though, you must have the courage to pursue
						and market a new idea or invention to the public.<br><br>
						You will also need money. Fortunately, you start with enough to
						begin the pursuit of one venture, but you can stay at your day job for
						longer in order to acquire more starting funds.<br><br>
						As you go through your venture, you will
						fail. A lot. But after failure comes success.	  
					</p>
				 </div>


				<div class="tabbertab" id="Tab2">
					<h2>Getting Started</h2>
					<p>
						In this game you have a choice of playing against other people or against the computer.
						You can play up to six players, so you first need to select your competition.
						When you select your competition you need to select a name and color of the
						business.Make sure you did the same for your own business and now you are ready to get started.	  
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="tabbertab" id="Tab3">
					<h2>Basic Rules</h2>
					<p>
						The main objective of this game is to obtain more money than all the
						other players. Each player will start with an equal amount of money
						to help them begin. The idea is to create products and take them 
						through the process an entrepreneur would go through.
						There are nine different phases a product will go through idea,
						design, prototype, testing prototype, development, testing prerelease
						product, deploy, testing post-release product, and maintenance.
						During a round a player will have a choice to do nothing, create a
						product, add employees, or move to the next product phase.
						Once you end your turn you will either gain money or lose money.
						Next the other player will have to do the same thing during their
						turn and so on until the final round is over	  
					</p>
				</div>
				 
				<div class="tabbertab" id="Tab4">
					<h2>Additional Rules</h2>
					<p>
						At the beginning of the game you can choice to do nothing each round
						and you will gain a set amount of money each round. This can be
						very beneficial at first since you might not have enough money to
						create your first product.
						Once your product is created you can hire different people to help
						you at each phase. There is a cost for each person you hire, so might
						want to be careful not to hire to many people. The people you hire
						will help you during certain phases of your product.
						Throughout the game there will be random events that can either
						help you or make things more difficult. For example you can get
						a tax break and increase your fund. Or the power goes out in your
						building and you need to send workers home.<br><br>
