All files here that do not have transparency (the background images for instance) should be Quality-100 JPGs. Make sure to use a program that lets you choose the quality setting when exporting as a JPG. For images with transparency, PNG is acceptable, as most browsers sadly don't have native support for JP2 (JPG 2000) or JNG (JPEG Network Graphics) yet.

We need the compression. Large size is unnaceptable for a lightweight web application. We're not making another Scrumwise.
