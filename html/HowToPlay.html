								The world of entrepreneurship is large, full of possibility,
								and--most of all-- random. The best method to teach you of the
								process behind and entrepreneurial venture is, and always will be,
								experience.<br>
								In this simulation, you take the role of an entrepreneur who is in
								the process of starting their own business. In order to begin your
								process, though, you must have the courage to pursue
								and market a new idea or invention to the public.<br>
								You will also need money. Fortunately, you start with enough to
								begin the pursuit of one venture, but you can stay at your day job for
								longer in order to acquire more starting funds.<br><br>
								As you go through your venture, you will
								fail. A lot. But after failure comes success.

							In this game you have a choice of playing alone or against other people (or computer players).
							Up to six players, computer or human, can play a game at once. If you want a particular player
							to not be in the game, simply leave that player's name blank. You can also choose your own color
							when setting up the players; more than one player can have the same color, even, but try not to
							get confused about who is who.

								   The main objective of this game is to obtain the most revenue out of
								   all players. Each player begins with $2000 to help them start, and to obtain
								   more revenue, one must pursue ventures and take each one through the life cycle
								   of an innovation.
								   There are nine different phases through which a product must go: Idea,
								   Design, Prototype, Testing Prototype, Development, Testing Pre-Release
								   Product, Deployment, Testing Post-Release Product, and Maintenance.
								   During their turn, the player has a few options, which include beginning
								   a venture (or putting a product on the board), moving that product through
								   the life cycle of an innovation, and hiring or firing employees.
								   It is at the beginning of each round that net gains or losses are calculated.

							A product's overall worth is determined by how high its idea strength, design strength, and build strength are.
							It will not be able to gain any sort of revenue without having at least one point in each of these fields.
							Also important to note is the product's stability: If your product is not too stable, you run the risk of losing revenue
							on it while it is in Maintenance and- in the worst case scenario- losing that product altogether if the failure
							is high enough. Remember, though, failure is not the end, so if your product fails on the market, try again!
							Product stat increases depend on where it is on the board: Idea strength in "Idea", Design strength in "Design",
							Build strength in "Development", and Stability in any of the "Testing" phases. You cannot increase design strength,
							build strength, or stability on your own, though; that is why you hire the respective employees.
							As for the "Prototype" and "Deployment" phases, a product must remain in those phases for at least one turn before
							it can progress beyond them. And it will cost you to go forward from the Prototype phase and to exit or revert to
							the Deployment phase.

							Do not leave a product in the same outer phase for too long. The amount of strength it gets per turn
							decreases proportionally to the amount of turns it's spent in that exact phase. Plus, some employees
							may get sick of working on the same product for too long and leave the work force!
							(You will be warned when a product has been in the same spot for a while.)<br>
							Something else to keep in mind is the type of events that can occur. There are a variety of them,
							some are helpful, and some can hamper your progress. But don't panic; that's life!
							You can also patent your product ideas if you have a good enough design! Remember, though: only one product per
							subcategory can be patented at a time, and you cannot patent any product that's already on the market!
							Owners of patents for products earn royalty revenue from other products of that category, which is a nice bonus.
